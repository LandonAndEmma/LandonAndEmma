    <h1>Hi, I’m Landon Perkins or my alias: LandonAndEmma!</h1>
    <div>
      I want to become a master ROM hacker, and video game creator, just like Ermelber and Notch.<br>
      I’m also interested in coding and the DS to Wii U era of Nintendo. I’m also currently learning C#. <br>
      I also use Pycharm and Visual Studio Community 2022 as my IDE. I'm currently in college! <br>
